Golden Shoe Case Study Prototype

This project was created as a prototype to demonstrate to a client the web design and some of the functionality the Golden Shoe website will have once it has been built. 

The homepage and the Womens heels page are the only two pages which have been built. The homepage is a fully presentational page whereas the womens heels page has search and basket functionality. 


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
